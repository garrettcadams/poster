                    We’re not using the official Instagram API which is 
                    available on Instagram Developer Center as it’s very limited. 
                    So we are using a different API. On the backend, the script 
                    behaves like the official Android app of the Instagram. We 
                    have taken all security measures to reduce the ban rate. 
                    If you don't publish spammy posts or don't try to send 
                    massive amount of the requests to the Instagram from the 
                    same account, there shouldn't be any problem.

                   AS IT’S VERY CLEAR, SCRIPT DEPENDS ON INSTAGRAM. WE’RE NOT 
                   RESPONSIBLE IF INSTAGRAM MADE CRITICAL CHANGES IN THEIR SIDE. 
                   ALTHOUGH WE ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE THE SCRIPT UP TO DATE, 
                   SOMETIMES IT MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO FIND A PROPER WORKAROUND. 
                   WE DON’T GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE SCRIPT WITH 
                   INSTAGRAM API WILL BE FOREVER, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. <span class='color-red'>WE DON’T
